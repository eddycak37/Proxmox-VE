# Proxmox-VE
In this installation and configuration, it was quite simple for me because I already done it before in July 2025. However, I will give you the step by step of what I had to do to prep the computer and everything else.

The computer used: Lenovo ThinkPad T480
- CPU: i5 8350u
- RAM: 16Gb DDR4-2400
- Storage: 256 Gb SSD
  - Additional storage
     - Western Digital Black SN770 2TB on an external enclosure -> To use with my Nextcloud configuration

# Preparation
There's nothing complicated in this part. Since you have to install a new OS in the computer, you have to make sure to keep all the files in a USB stick since everything will be deleted. In my case, I only had Kali Linux installed with no files or stuff that I wanted to keep. Next, you have to download the ISO of the open-software server management that you want. I went with [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads) because like I said before, I already knew what to do and how to install it. However, I will still give the link to the video that I used before that gave me the step by step installation.
